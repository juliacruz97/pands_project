Dataset Information:

What do the instances in this dataset represent?
Each instance is a plant

Additional Information:

This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

For each classified type of plant, we will use four different measurements to evaluate 50 samples in each species.

# Plant classes (Iris's  Flower)
 Iris Setosa,  Iris Versicolour,  Iris Virginica

# Variables analyzed for each sample:

 sepal length 
 sepal width 
 petal length 
 petal width
