 
 # Classification:  Iris Setosa 
 
 # Iris setosa is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family, 
 # belonging to the Iris genus, which includes various species known for 
 # their showy flowers. Iris setosa is commonly found in temperate regions 
 # of the Northern Hemisphere, especially in wet and cold areas like 
 # North America (particularly in Alaska) and parts of Europe and Asia.
 
# Key Characteristics:
 
# Height: Typically grows between 30 to 60 cm tall.

# Leaves: Its leaves are long, narrow, and upright, with a grayish-green hue.

# Flowers: The flowers are typical of the Iris genus, with three large, 
# drooping outer petals (called "falls") and three smaller, upright inner petals 
# (called "standards"). The flower color ranges from blue to purple, 
# but there are also varieties with white or pink flowers.

# Habitat: Iris setosa prefers wet environments, such as riverbanks, marshes, 
# and meadows. It is well-adapted to cold climates, making it common in arctic 
# and subarctic regions.

 # sepal length =  In the analysis of the 50 samples of the iris setosa, 
 # we noticed that there was a range in the sepal length between 4.3cm 
 # and 5.8cm, however it was possible to verify a greater number of 
 # (20 samples) measuring 5cm and 5.1cm.
 
 # sepal width =In the analysis of the 50 samples of the defined iris, 
 # we noticed that there was a variation in the width of the sepal 
 # between 2.3 cm and 4.4 cm, however it was possible to verify a 
 # greater number of (15 samples) measuring 3 cm and 3.5 cm.
 
 # petal length= In the analysis of the 50 samples of the defined iris, 
 # we noticed that there was a variation in the petal_length between 
 # 1 cm and 1.9 cm, however it was possible to verify a greater number of 
 # (26 samples) measuring 1.4 cm and 1.5 cm. 
 
 # petal width = In the analysis of the 50 samples of the defined iris, 
 # we noticed that there was a variation in the petal_width between 0.1 cm 
 # and 0.6 cm, however it was possible to verify a greater number of 
 # (28 samples) measuring 0.2 cm.

 # These observations were possible and visible through the histogram 
 # built with df iris. 
 # # in the correlation graph we observe that there is a correlation 
 # between the measurements of the study variables.
